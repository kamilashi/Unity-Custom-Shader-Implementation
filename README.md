# Shader Demo Project
 The shader code files are located in Assets/Shaders.
 The s_wall shader is the updated one that accepts pattern textures, and all of the materials inside the scene use just this one shader.
 The s_floor shader is essentially the same as s_wall since it uses the same code.

 Use W/S to dolly, mouse to rotate the camera and H to hide/unhide UI.
